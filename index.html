  <p>WEB is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth <br>
    as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming": <br>
    the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code <br>
    inside descriptive text,  rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages), <br>
    in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.</p>
  <p>WEB consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code, <br>
    from the source texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX.</p>
